        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>

            <li>Semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>

        <img src="images/chocolate_chip_banana_bread.jpg" width = "400" alt="A chocolate chip banana bread loaf in a tin">

        <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350º. Line a 9"-by-5" loaf pan with parchment and grease with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in walnuts and chocolate chips and transfer to prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>

        <h2>Homemade Mac & Cheese</h2>
        <h3 class="mini">Origin: Northern Europe</h3>
        <h3 class="mini">Source: <a href ="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a44763401/mac-and-cheese-recipe/">Homemade Mac & Cheese Recipe</a></h3>

        <img src="images/mac&cheese.jpg" width = "400" alt="A wooden spoon scooping a serving of Mac & Cheese">

        <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Macaroni</li>
            <li>Butter and flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring, until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>

        <h2>Swedish Pancakes</h2>
        <h3 class="mini">Origin: Sweden</h3>
        <h3 class="mini">Source: <a href ="https://true-north-kitchen.com/swedish-pancakes-with-lingonberries/">Kristi (True North Kitchen)</a></h3>
        <h3 class="mini">Category: Breakfast</h3>
        <img src="images/swedish-pancakes-platted.jpeg" width = "400" alt="A plate with three swedish pancakes and a berry compote">

        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity. (Kristi, 2023)</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.
            <li>Stir the batter briefly to recombine.</li>
            <li>Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
